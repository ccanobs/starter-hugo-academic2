Currently, I am an associate professor at the Faculty of Computer Science and Telecomunications of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), where I mainly teach math courses. I am also a research member of the WINE group also at UOC.\nMy research interests include coexistence of wireless heterogeneous networks and distributed resource allocation. Recently, I became interested in science and technology studies, trying to understand the intertwining of the social and the technological in the development of wireless networks, with special interest in the environmental impact of mobile networks.\nAlthough it says little about the quality of my research, it’s probably worth to mention that I appeared in the inaugural list “Rising Stars in Networking/Communications” of the N2Women organisation and that I have published 20 JCR journals and more than 30 conference articles (5 of them received the best paper award), attracting more than 2000 citations and resulting in a h-index of 23 according to Google Scholar, all of this related to my work on wireless network optimization.\n","date":1671544275,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1671544275,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I hold a Ph.D. (2011) in Information, Communication and Audiovisual Media Technologies from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF).

We argue this is a too narrow perspective on sustainability, as it ignores the effects of the increased traffic demand these networks stimulate and the need for additional equipment that this demand requires. The hope is that techniques to reduce the network’s energy consumption in operation will be able to compensate for increases in traffic demand. However, we argue that there are more challenges than just reducing the energy that the network requires to function and that it is not clear whether higher energy efficiency will be able to cope with increasing demand.","tags":null,"title":"5/6G: Networks of the Future or Defuturing Networks?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cristina Cano"],"categories":[],"content":"When we think about the environmental impact of mobile networks, we often think about energy consumption. However, there are other dimensions that have to be taken into account, especially when we consider the materiality of the network and the devices needed for access. Yet, there is also another important aspect to consider: induction. That is, the increased use of an application or a service that a technological advancement enables. In the case of mobile networks, such as 5G or 6G, the applications themselves push for a higher network utilization. Increased used implies the need for higher capacity (effectively resulting in more base stations using higher frequency), more specialized hardware and processing capability, resulting in a higher need for energy and materials.\nM﻿obile networks are seen as both an enabler and a problem for sustainability. While it is argued that they can bring benefits in a range of sectors, due to digitalization and optimization, the implementation of the infrastructure needed to provide these services as well as its operation has material needs. We argue that the whole life cycle of the devices needs to be accounted for and that we need to move beyond the energy consumption per bit as a measure of efficiency and start paying attention to total energy consumption, which may increase with increased traffic demand.\nI﻿f you are interested in this topic, check the following articles I have written along with Hug March:\n5/6G: Networks of the Future or Defuturing Networks?\nRedes 5G y 6G: Las implicaciones sociales y ambientales de la hiperconectividad que se avecina\nO﻿ur digital life has unquestionable energy and infrastructure needs\n","date":1671542720,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"279b9966ca9cf3121ce924dca452bb1c","permalink":"https://ccanobs.github.io/post/getting-started/","publishdate":"2022-12-20T13:25:20.251Z","relpermalink":"/post/getting-started/","section":"post","summary":"When we think about the environmental impact of mobile networks, we often think about energy consumption.
