abstract: Energy efficiency is at the core of sustainability solutions for 5/6G
  networks. We argue this is a too narrow perspective on sustainability, as it
  ignores the effects of the increased traffic demand these networks stimulate
  and the need for additional equipment that this demand requires. The hope is
  that techniques to reduce the networkâ€™s energy consumption in operation will
  be able to compensate for increases in traffic demand. However, we argue that
  there are more challenges than just reducing the energy that the network
  requires to function and that it is not clear whether higher energy efficiency
  will be able to cope with increasing demand.
