  Energy efficiency is at the core of sustainability solutions for 5/6G
  networks. We argue this is a too narrow perspective on sustainability, as it
  ignores the effects of the increased traffic demand these networks stimulate
  and the need for additional equipment that this demand requires. The hope is
  that techniques to reduce the networkâ€™s energy consumption in operation will
  be able to compensate for increases in traffic demand. However, we argue that
  there are more challenges than just reducing the energy that the network
  requires to function

  and that it is not clear whether higher energy efficiency will be able to cope with increasing demand. The need for more equipment related to deployment of 5/6G networks (both at the user end, network level and the cloud and grid) may result in important environmental impacts related to: i) increased pressures on material extraction, which imply socio-environmental conflicts, ecosystem destruction and displacement, ii) more manufacturing

  and shipment, with effects on greenhouse gas emissions and pollution; iii) increased disposal complexities and challenges to recycle components of such equipments. By extending our view on sustainability to include the aforementioned often ignored implications, we are able to identify design requirements and technical pillars of 5/6G networks that need to be rethought. We also devise new paths forward to address these challenges. We

  argue that it is crucial to think of alternative applications and requirements that aim to serve user demands explicitly, instead of incessantly creating new needs. We also claim that acknowledging material limitations in the production of new hardware is critical, promoting retrofitting and modular design in future network development. The conclusions of this article show that it is time to start rethinking the course of mobile network development in

  order to align it to current environmental objectives to tackle the climate emergency the world is experiencing.
