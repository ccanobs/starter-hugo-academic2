I hold a Ph.D. (2011) in Information, Communication and Audiovisual Media Technologies from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). I have been a research fellow in the Hamilton Institute of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (2012-2014), in Trinity College Dublin (2015-2016) and in Inria- Lille in France (first half of 2016). Currently, I am an associate professor at the WINE research group of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). In August 2016, I featured the list "Rising Stars in Networking/Communications" of the N2Women organisation. I have published 20 JCR journals and more than 30 conference articles (5 of them received the best paper award), attracting more than 2000 citations and resulting in an h-index of 23 according to Google Scholar.

My research interests include coexistence of wireless heterogeneous networks and distributed resource allocation. Recently, I became interested in science and technology studies, trying to understand the social dimension of the technological development of wireless networks with special interest in their environmental impact.
